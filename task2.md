# XML Schema Test Generator: Flexibility Enhancement Plan

## Objective
Make the XML Schema Test Generator fully schema-agnostic, removing all hard-coded references to specific schema elements, and ensure it can handle any compliant XML Schema without manual configuration.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Remove Hard-coded Element References ✓
**Where:** EnumerationTestGenerator.java
**Issue:** The code contained explicit checks for specific element names like "cars", "bikes", and "vehicles".
**Solution:** Implemented schema-driven generation instead of using hard-coded element names.
- Removed element name checks in EnumerationTestGenerator.generateChildAttributeEnumerationTests()
- Replaced special case handling with generalized structure detection
- Created utility methods to determine an element's role in the schema
- Refactored vehicle-specific XML generation with schema-driven generation

### 2. Enhance Schema Type Support ✓
**Where:** XmlValueHelper.java
**Issue:** The value generator had limited support for XSD types and didn't handle complex types systematically.
**Solution:** Extended XmlValueHelper to support all common XSD types:
- Added support for all string types (normalizedString, token, language, etc.)
- Added support for all numeric types (decimal, integer, float, etc.)
- Added support for all date/time-related types (date, time, dateTime, etc.)
- Added support for binary types (hexBinary, base64Binary)
- Added support for miscellaneous types (boolean, QName, anyURI, etc.)
- Implemented proper value generation for each type based on constraints

### 3. Fix Nested Method and Code Structure Issues ✓
**Where:** TestXmlGenerator.java
**Issue:** The code contained incorrectly nested method definitions and structural issues.
**Solution:** Refactored TestXmlGenerator.java to fix structure:
- Fixed the nested findElementByNameRecursive method
- Reorganized the code into smaller, more focused methods
- Improved readability with better method naming
- Added proper error handling

### 4. Fix Reference Resolution ✓
**Where:** SchemaParser.java, TestXmlGenerator.java
**Issue:** Element references (`<element ref="...">`) weren't completely resolved throughout the codebase.
**Solution:**
- Added complete reference resolution for elements, types, and groups
- Implemented proper namespace handling in references
- Added mechanisms to detect and handle circular references
- Added tracking of resolved references to avoid duplication

### 5. Improve Compositor Handling ✓
**Where:** SchemaParser.java - findChildElements method
**Issue:** The method only handled top-level sequence, choice, and all compositors.
**Solution:**
- Refactored findChildElements to handle nested compositors recursively
- Added support for group references
- Implemented substitution group handling
- Improved handling of xs:choice for test case generation
- Added support for different minOccurs/maxOccurs settings in compositors

### 6. Clean Up Debugging and Improve Logging ✓
**Where:** Across codebase
**Issue:** Contains System.out.println debug statements instead of proper logging.
**Solution:**
- Added java.util.logging support throughout the codebase
- Replaced all println statements with appropriate log levels
- Added contextual information to log messages
- Added exception handling with logging

## Remaining Tasks

### 7. Create Comprehensive Tests
**Where:** New test package
**Issue:** No automated tests to verify behavior with different schemas.
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create JUnit test suite
- [ ] Add tests with diverse schema examples (OAGIS, UBL, DocBook, MathML, SVG)
- [ ] Add validation to verify generated XML files pass schema validation

### 8. Add Configuration Options
**Where:** XMLSchemaTestGenerator.java
**Issue:** Limited configuration options for controlling test generation.
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add command-line options for controlling output directories, log levels, etc.
- [ ] Create a configuration class to hold settings
- [ ] Add documentation for configuration options

### 9. Improve Error Recovery and Reporting
**Where:** Across codebase
**Issue:** Error handling is inconsistent, with some errors silently caught.
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Standardize error handling approach
- [ ] Improve error messages with context
- [ ] Add recovery strategies for non-fatal errors
- [ ] Create a summary report of test generation results
